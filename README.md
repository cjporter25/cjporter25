- 👋 Hi, I’m @cjporter25
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, primarily that of data science or 3D graphical interfaces such as engineering software or Video Games. I prefer C++, despise HTML and Javascript, enjoy Python, but can and am willing to learn what is necessary for any career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at University of Arkansas, Grantham and had originally studied at UC San Diego
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App idea similar to the u.gg or op.gg websites that curates data for specificied groups of players in League of Legends. Eventually I hope to take this knowledge and apply it towards my future career requirements.
- 📫 How to reach me: chris.j.porter25@gmail.com
