- 👋 Hi, I’m @cjporter25
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, primarily that of data science or 3D graphical interfaces such as engineering software or Video Games. I prefer C++ but need a way to practice, despise HTML and Javascript, really enjoy Python and developed the backend systems to a future web application I'm building. I am, however, always willing to learn what is necessary for any career in computer science
- 🌱 I originally started my college career at UC Sandiego but have since moved and completed my education at University of Arkansas, Grantham. The degree of which is a B.S. in Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App idea similar to the u.gg or op.gg websites that curates data for specificied groups of players in League of Legends. Eventually I hope to take this knowledge and apply it towards my future career requirements.
