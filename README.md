- 👋 Hi, I’m @cjporter25
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, primarily that of data science or 3D graphical interfaces such as engineering software or Video Games. I prefer C based languages, but am actively looking for ways to learn and practice. I despise HTML and Javascript but really enjoy Python and developed the backend systems to a future web application I'm building. I am, however, always willing to learn what is necessary for any career I find myself in.
- 🌱 I originally started my college career at UC San Diego, but have since moved, and completed my education at University of Arkansas Grantham. The degree of which was a B.S. in Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App idea similar to the u.gg or op.gg websites that curates data for specificied groups of players in League of Legends. The repository for this app, "TheSquad", can be found in my profile as a pinned project. Eventually I hope to take this knowledge and apply it towards my future career goals!
