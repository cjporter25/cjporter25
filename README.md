- 👋 Hi, I’m @cjporter25
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, primarily that of data science or 3D graphical interfaces such as engineering software or Video Games. I prefer Python & data science related tasks, but I am always looking for ways to learn and practice all languages and forms of software development.
- 🌱 I originally started my college career at UC San Diego, but have since moved, and completed my education at University of Arkansas Grantham. The degree of which was a B.S. in Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App idea similar to the u.gg or op.gg websites that curates data for specificied groups of players in League of Legends rather than an individual player. I then create a curated set of statistics to provide insight on who's the best contributor to the team depending on a variety of factors. I am now working on a machine learning component that will recommend champions in live games.
- The repository for this app, "TheSquad", can be found in my profile as a pinned project under thesquad-api-demo. This repository is a showcase of the code as the actual production code must remain secretive as it involves secure api-keys. Eventually I hope to take this knowledge and apply it towards my future career goals!
